# MCP tool reference

All 21 tools exposed by the `watch-skill` MCP server
(`src/watch_skill/surfaces/mcp/server.py`), with parameters, defaults, and
what comes back. Every tool has a REST twin — the mapping table is at the
bottom.

Two conventions hold everywhere:

- **Errors are structured.** Failures return
  `{"error": "<code>", "message": ..., "fix": ..., "details": {...}}` —
  act on `fix` (it usually says "run doctor" or names the setting to
  change). Error codes are namespaced by stage: `acquire.*`, `perceive.*`,
  `transcribe.*`, `index.*`, `vision.*`, `loop.*`, `health.*`, `config.*`.
- **Images are capped.** Responses attach at most
  `WATCHSKILL_RESPONSE_FRAME_CAP` images (even-sampled, first + last kept);
  retrieval is designed to make more unnecessary.

Times are accepted as `SS`, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS` everywhere a timestamp
or range is a parameter.

## Watch & ask

### `watch_video`

First look at any video you have **not** analyzed yet. Downloads, extracts
scene-aware deduplicated frames, OCRs them, transcribes (captions first,
then local whisper), and indexes everything. For follow-ups call
`ask_video` — never re-watch.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | str | required | Any yt-dlp-supported URL (1800+ sites), direct media URL, HLS/DASH manifest, or local file path |
| `question` | str | — | Echoed in the report header so the agent answers it from the returned evidence |
| `start` / `end` | str | — | Zoom into a section with denser sampling |
| `budget` | int | config | Frame-count cap for this call |
| `background` | bool | `false` | Return a `job_id` instantly; poll `get_status` (use for long videos or strict client timeouts) |

Returns a markdown report (metadata, frame selection, OCR, transcript)
prefixed with the `video_id`, plus key frames as images.

### `get_status`

Poll a background job started with `watch_video(background=true)`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `job_id` | str | required | From the `watch_video` background response |

Returns status/phase/progress JSON; when done it includes the `video_id`
and the exact `ask_video` call to make next. Poll every few seconds, not
in a tight loop.

### `ask_video`

Any follow-up question about a video already watched — by anyone, in any
session. The self-healing answer engine retrieves from the persistent
index, scores its own confidence, escalates when unsure (dense
re-sampling, zoom-crop re-OCR, stronger model), and says plainly when the
video does not clearly show the answer — it never guesses.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or the original source URL/path |
| `question` | str | required | Natural language, any language |
| `max_frames` | int | `6` | Cap on attached evidence frames |
| `include_frames` | bool | engine | Force frames on/off; default attaches them only when the engine could not verify |
| `verify` | bool | config | Force the model verify pass on/off |

Returns text-first evidence with timestamps plus a metadata line
(`confidence`, `verified`, `cached`, `escalations_used`, tokens saved).

### `get_moment`

Zoom into one specific moment of an indexed video ("what happens at
2:30?"), or expand around an `ask_video` hit.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or original source |
| `timestamp` | str | required | Center of the window |
| `window` | float | `10.0` | Seconds of context around the timestamp |

Returns dense frames + transcript + OCR within the window.

## Across the whole index

### `search_videos`

Find something across **every** video ever watched, when you don't know
which video contains it. Hybrid keyword + semantic search with proper
per-script normalization (Arabic folding, CJK segmentation).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | str | required | Keywords or a phrase, any language |

Returns videos with timestamped evidence — follow up with `ask_video` or
`get_moment` on a hit.

### `list_videos`

See what is already indexed (id, title, duration, transcript source,
analyzed date). No parameters. Check here **before** `watch_video` when
the video might have been analyzed in an earlier session.

## Learning & token economy

### `report_mistake`

A video answer turned out wrong? Report it with the correction — Watch
Skill learns from it locally (nothing uploaded): the mistake is
classified, stored as a lesson, injected into future similar questions,
and where possible the original question is re-asked immediately to
confirm the lesson works.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or original source |
| `question` | str | required | The question that was answered wrongly |
| `wrong_answer` | str | required | What was (wrongly) said |
| `correction` | str | required | What the correct answer actually is |
| `session_id` | str | — | Group lessons under a session |

Returns the lesson (`lesson_id`, `error_class`, `content_type`,
`guidance`, `validated`) and, when re-asked, the validation outcome.

### `stats`

Lifetime token-savings meter: how many tokens text-first answers + the
semantic cache have saved vs naive raw-frame injection. No parameters.

## Capture & THE LOOP

### `capture`

Record **new** footage when none exists yet, then analyze + index it like
any other video.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | str | required | `http(s)` URL (headless browser), `screen:` (full desktop), `window:<exact title>`, or an existing video file |
| `duration` | float | `10.0` | Recording length in seconds |
| `script` | list[dict] | — | Browser steps: `goto` / `click` / `fill` / `scroll` / `wait` |

Returns the `video_id` plus the watch report. To record **and** judge
against pass criteria, use `loop_start` instead — capture alone never
critiques.

### `loop_start`

Start THE LOOP when you built or changed something visual and need to
verify it actually looks right: records the target, watches the
recording, and critiques it against your natural-language pass criteria.
The loop **observes — it never edits anything itself**; you apply the
fixes, then call `loop_iterate`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | str | required | Same forms as `capture` |
| `pass_criteria` | str | required | Natural language, e.g. "the checkout total renders a real price" |
| `script` | list[dict] | — | Same interaction script, replayed identically every iteration |
| `max_iterations` | int | `5` | Stop condition |
| `duration` | float | `8.0` | Recording length per iteration |

Returns `loop_id`, verdict, score, and structured issues with timestamps
and suggested fixes.

### `loop_iterate`

Continue the loop — call **only after** you actually changed the code/UI.
Re-captures the same target with the same script, re-critiques, and diffs
against the previous iteration (fixed / unchanged / new issues). Stops on
pass, `max_iterations`, or no-progress; on pass it renders the
before/after MP4 + GIF proof.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `loop_id` | str | required | From `loop_start` |

### `loop_status`

Inspect a loop's persisted state (status, score history per iteration,
artifact paths).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `loop_id` | str | required | From `loop_start` |

### `loop_video_gen`

Start a **video-generation loop**: run any generator command
(Manim/Remotion/ffmpeg/AI-gen), watch the video it writes, critique it
against the spec, and iterate until the render matches. You edit the
generator between iterations; `loop_iterate` re-runs and re-judges it.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec` | str | required | What the generated video must show |
| `generator_cmd` | str | required | Shell command that renders the video |
| `output` | str | required | The video file the command writes (stale renders are deleted first) |
| `pass_criteria` | str | spec | Overrides the spec for the critic |
| `workdir` | str | — | Working directory for the command |
| `max_iterations` | int | `5` | Stop condition |
| `timeout` | float | `600` | Generator timeout in seconds |

### `loop_game`

Start a **game/simulation loop**: optionally launch the game, record
gameplay from a canvas URL / `window:<title>` / `screen:`, and critique the
recording for visual glitches and state failures (a `NaN` score counter,
black flicker frames, missing sprites).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | str | required | Canvas game URL, `window:<title>`, or `screen:` |
| `pass_criteria` | str | required | e.g. "the SCORE counter must show a number (like SCORE: 12), never NaN" |
| `run_cmd` | str | — | Command that launches the game (terminated after recording) |
| `script` | list[dict] | — | Browser interaction steps for canvas games |
| `duration` | float | `10.0` | Recording length per iteration |
| `max_iterations` | int | `5` | Stop condition |

### `loop_monitor`

Watch a **folder of videos or a live target** until a described condition
appears, then return a structured event (also appended to `events.jsonl`
under the monitor's loop dir). Bounded by `max_checks` — it always
terminates. Folder sources consume each video once; live targets sample
`sample_seconds` every `interval`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | str | required | Folder path, URL, `screen:`, or `window:<title>` |
| `condition` | str | required | Plain language, e.g. "an error screen (like ERROR 502)" |
| `interval` | float | `10.0` | Seconds between live checks |
| `max_checks` | int | `10` | Hard bound on checks |
| `sample_seconds` | float | `5.0` | Live sample length per check |

## Structured extraction

### `extract_chapters`

Segment an already-watched video into titled chapters with start/end
timestamps, from scene changes + transcript topic shifts. Deterministic —
answers straight from the index, no extra model calls.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or original source |

### `extract_bug_report`

QA mode: pinpoint where an error appears in a watched screen recording —
timestamp, frame, exact on-screen error text (OCR), and the steps that led
up to it. Returns `found: false` when no error signal exists.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or original source |

### `analyze_hook`

Creator mode: score the first N seconds as a hook — attention trigger in
the opening line, speech pacing, visual change rate, on-screen text — each
with an actionable critique, plus a combined 0-100 score and verdict.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or original source |
| `seconds` | float | `15.0` | Opening window to score |

## Batch & sharing

### `watch_batch`

Watch + index a whole set in one call: a playlist/channel URL
(auto-expanded), a folder of video files, or an explicit list. Everything
lands in the same persistent index, so one `search_videos`/`ask_video`
afterwards spans the entire batch. One failing video never stops the rest.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sources` | list[str] | required | URLs/paths, folders, or playlist URLs |
| `limit` | int | `20` | Max videos to process |

### `generate_viewer`

Render a shareable, self-contained HTML page for an analyzed video:
timeline + key frames (inlined — works offline, zero external requests),
transcript, on-screen text, and every cached answer with the exact evidence
cited. The file opens directly in any browser and can be sent to anyone.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `video` | str | required | `video_id` or original source |
| `out_path` | str | cwd | Where to write the HTML file |

## Health

### `doctor`

Run when **any** other tool fails with a dependency or download error, or
on first use. Checks and self-heals: installs missing ffmpeg/yt-dlp,
updates a stale yt-dlp, verifies disk space, GPU, and API keys. No
parameters. Each failing check includes a `fix` you can act on.

## REST twins

The REST API (`watch-skill api`, OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json`) mirrors
every tool for non-MCP agents:

| MCP tool | REST endpoint |
|---|---|
| `watch_video` | `POST /v1/watch` |
| `ask_video` | `POST /v1/answer` (full Answer payload; `POST /v1/ask` is raw retrieval) |
| `get_moment` | `GET /v1/videos/{video}/moment` |
| `search_videos` | `GET /v1/search?q=` |
| `list_videos` | `GET /v1/videos` |
| `capture` | `POST /v1/capture` |
| `loop_start` | `POST /v1/loops` |
| `loop_iterate` | `POST /v1/loops/{loop_id}/iterate` |
| `loop_status` | `GET /v1/loops/{loop_id}` |
| `doctor` | `POST /v1/doctor` |

(`get_status`, `report_mistake`, and `stats` are MCP/CLI-side:
backgrounding is an MCP transport concern, and lessons/stats have CLI
surfaces — `watch-skill lessons add`, `watch-skill stats`. The v0.7 tools
have CLI twins instead of REST ones for now: `watch-skill loop
video-gen|game|monitor`, `watch-skill extract chapters|bug-report|hook`,
`watch-skill batch`, and `watch-skill viewer`.)

REST-only details: frames come back as filesystem paths plus optional
base64 (`inline_frames`), and when `WATCHSKILL_API_BEARER_TOKEN` is set
every request must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (without a token
the API refuses to bind to non-loopback hosts).

Per-call parameters here override the corresponding
[configuration](../configuration.md) setting for that one call.
